# The Testing Pyramid 

TODO Coming soon

The testing pyramid came from a measurement that took into account the proportions of test type in relation to one another. A direct correlation was observed between testing strategies that did not have the proportions of a pyramid, and those that were painful, difficult to maintain and slow. The testing pyramid is a guideline that is based on the symptoms of test strategies. It does not really tell you a huge amount about the cause at a glance.
