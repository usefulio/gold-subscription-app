#### Techniques & Concepts

* ***BDD and TDD*** are used together<br/>
  If you think you know what BDD is, please read [our description](./content/BDD.md) and make sure. Most developers we talk to think they know but actually don't! 

* ***Modelling by Example*** *is employed from the outset*<br/>
  This combines disciplines from Domain Drive Design and Specification by Example. It is a highly methodical and iterative approach to software development. If you haven't used this technique before, please read [our overview](./content/MODELLING-BY-EXAMPLE.md)

* ***The Testing Pyramid*** *is adhered to 100%*<br/>
  Interestingly this doesn't require any extra effort, it is a side-effect of the Modelling by Example technique. If you don't know what the testing pyramid is, please read [our description](./content/TESTING-PYRAMID.md)
